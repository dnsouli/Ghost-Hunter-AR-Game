# Ghost-Hunter-AR-Game
An AR application, in which the player shoots ghosts for points using their mobile camera in an arcade style shooting gallery.

## Game Description
Ghost Hunter is a Halloween themed AR application, in which malicious ghostly spirits exist in our world and the player takes on the role of a ghost hunter to help eliminate them. In this case, the player’s phone acts as ecto-goggles, allowing any ordinary mortal to be able to see the ghostly spirits roaming around their surroundings. However, the goggles only work for a limited time before they need to recharge.

Functionally, the game is a first person shooter, in which the player moves their phone camera around their play space to find enemy ghosts to destroy. The challenge comes from having to quickly move the phone in order to find ghosts that are not in view of the player’s camera. Each ghost destroyed will reward the player five points, tasking the player to score as many points as possible before the round ends. Each round lasts for fifty seconds before totalling up the user’s score on the “game over” screen. The main function of shooting is activated by a button that the player taps with their thumb as they hold the phone.
